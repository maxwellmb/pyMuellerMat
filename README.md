# pyMuellerMat
A general python library for creating and working with Mueller matrices for polarimetry applications. I mostly developed it for my own use, but it should be fairly straightforward to use so the respository is public. I don't pretend be any kind of software architect, so if you have any suggestions drop me a line.  

Feel free to use the package with the license described on Github. I would love to know if other people are using it.
